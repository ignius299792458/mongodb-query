# **Data Modeling & Schema Design in MongoDB**, 
structured around the key concepts you listed, all based on best practices and guidance from [MongoDB‚Äôs official documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/data-modeling-introduction/).

---

## üîπ 1. **Document-Oriented Design (BSON)**

MongoDB stores data in **BSON (Binary JSON)** format, which extends JSON to support additional data types like `Date`, `ObjectId`, `Decimal128`, etc. Each **document** is a semi-structured record (like a JSON object), stored in **collections** (equivalent to tables in RDBMS).

### Characteristics:

* Documents can have **nested objects** and **arrays**.
* Each document can have a **different structure**, though you should apply consistency for maintainability.
* BSON enables **rich, hierarchical data models**.

### Example:

```json
{
  "_id": ObjectId("..."),
  "name": "Ignius",
  "address": {
    "street": "123 Mongo Lane",
    "city": "Atlas",
    "zip": "12345"
  },
  "skills": ["Go", "Node.js", "MongoDB"]
}
```

## üîπ 2. **Embedded vs Referenced Documents**

### ‚û§ **Embedding** (Denormalization)

* Embed related data within a single document.
* Ideal when:

    * Data is accessed together.
    * The embedded data is not large or unbounded.
    * Write and read consistency is required (atomicity).

#### ‚úÖ Benefits:

* Fast reads (everything is in one document).
* Atomic updates (MongoDB updates are atomic at the document level).

#### ‚ùå Drawbacks:

* Redundant data.
* Document size is capped at 16MB.
* Difficult to update shared sub-documents.

### ‚û§ **Referencing** (Normalization)

* Store related documents in separate collections and use references (`_id`).
* Use `$lookup` for joins in queries.

#### ‚úÖ Benefits:

* Efficient when data is large or frequently updated independently.
* No size limitations.

#### ‚ùå Drawbacks:

* More complex queries.
* Potentially slower reads due to multiple queries or joins.

## üîπ 3. **Use Embedding For Atomicity and Fast Reads**

Atomicity in MongoDB is **document-level**: if you embed all related data in one document, operations like updates and inserts are atomic across the entire structure.

### Example:

```json
{
  "_id": ObjectId("..."),
  "customer": "Jane Doe",
  "orders": [
    { "item": "Laptop", "price": 1200 },
    { "item": "Mouse", "price": 25 }
  ]
}
```

This allows you to insert or update the entire order history in a single atomic write.

---

## üîπ 4. **Use Referencing for Large, Related Datasets**

If a user has thousands of orders or products, storing them in a single document would:

* Risk exceeding the 16MB limit.
* Create performance bottlenecks.

### Reference Model:

```json
// User document
{
  "_id": ObjectId("..."),
  "name": "Ignius",
  "orders": [ObjectId("order1"), ObjectId("order2")]
}

// Order documents in a separate collection
{
  "_id": ObjectId("order1"),
  "item": "Keyboard",
  "price": 75
}
```

---

## üîπ 5. **Modeling Relationships (1:1, 1\:N, M\:N)**

### One-to-One

* Embed if always accessed together.
* Reference if separation improves clarity.

### One-to-Many

* Embed if the many side is small and static.
* Reference if many side is large or updated frequently.

### Many-to-Many

* Always reference.
* Use bridge collections if needed.

#### Example: Tags on posts (M\:N)

```json
// Post
{ _id: 1, title: "MongoDB Design", tagIds: [1, 2] }

// Tag
{ _id: 1, name: "database" }
```

---

## üîπ 6. **Schema Validation (\$jsonSchema)**

MongoDB allows applying **schema validation rules** at the collection level to enforce structure, types, and required fields.

### Example:

```json
{
  $jsonSchema: {
    bsonType: "object",
    required: ["name", "email"],
    properties: {
      name: { bsonType: "string" },
      email: { bsonType: "string", pattern: "^.+@.+$" },
      age: { bsonType: "int", minimum: 18 }
    }
  }
}
```

Apply with `db.createCollection()` or `collMod` to existing ones.

---

## üîπ 7. **Avoid Massive Documents (16MB Limit)**

MongoDB documents must be ‚â§ 16MB in size. To avoid this:

* Never embed unbounded arrays (e.g., chat messages, logs).
* Use pagination or split documents logically.
* Consider referencing for large content.

---

## üîπ 8. **Polymorphic Documents**

Store documents with **similar but not identical structures**. Add a `type` field to distinguish.

### Example:

```json
// User types
{ _id: 1, type: "admin", permissions: ["read", "write"] }
{ _id: 2, type: "guest", expiresAt: "2025-06-01T00:00:00Z" }
```

* Useful for multi-role systems or different content types in a single collection.
* Avoid excessive polymorphism which complicates indexing and queries.

---

## üîπ 9. **Schema Versioning (\_v or \_schemaVersion)**

Over time, schemas evolve. To avoid migration issues:

* Use a field like `_v` or `_schemaVersion` to track schema version.
* Write logic to handle old formats in application code.
* Run migrations gradually.

### Example:

```json
{
  "_id": ObjectId("..."),
  "name": "Ignius",
  "_schemaVersion": 2
}
```

Allows backward compatibility and smooth transitions.

| **Referencing**  | Large, shared, or independently updated data                 |
| **Validation**   | Enforce structure using `$jsonSchema`                        |
| **Polymorphism** | Support multiple types in one collection with a `type` field |
| **Versioning**   | Evolve schema without breaking existing data                 |
