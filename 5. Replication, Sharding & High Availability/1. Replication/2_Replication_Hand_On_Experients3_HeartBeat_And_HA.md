# 11. MongoDB Replica Set Heartbeats — Who Sends Them?

In a MongoDB **replica set**, **each node (mongod instance)** sends **heartbeats** every **2 seconds** to **every other node** in the set.

---

### 🔁 How It Works:

- Every member of the replica set maintains **TCP connections** to the others.
- Every **2 seconds**, each node sends a small **heartbeat message** to check:

  - Is the other node **alive**?
  - Is it **healthy**?
  - What is its **replica set state** (PRIMARY, SECONDARY, etc.)?
  - What's its **oplog time** (to track sync status)?

---

### 👥 So, in a 3-node replica set:

| From \ To | mongo1 → | mongo2 → | mongo3 → |
| --------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| mongo1    | ❌       | ✅       | ✅       |
| mongo2    | ✅       | ❌       | ✅       |
| mongo3    | ✅       | ✅       | ❌       |

Every node sends to every **other** node — but **not to itself**.

---

### 🔍 Where You Can See This:

If you run:

```bash
docker logs mongo1
```

You may see logs like:

```
[Replication] Heartbeat to mongo2:27017 succeeded.
[Replication] Heartbeat to mongo3:27017 failed, retrying...
```

Or when a node fails:

```
[Replication] Could not reach mongo2:27017. Marking as DOWN.
```

---

### 🧠 Why This Matters:

- If **no heartbeat response** is received for \~10 seconds, the node is marked as **unreachable**.
- If the PRIMARY becomes unreachable, the replica set triggers a **failover** and elects a new PRIMARY.

### 🫀 How MongoDB Heartbeat "Ordering" Works in a Replica Set

MongoDB **does not** follow a _strict order_ when sending heartbeats. Instead, heartbeats are:

- **Peer-to-peer** (each node independently checks others)
- **Parallel** (nodes heartbeat others at the same time)
- Sent on a **regular interval** (every 2 seconds)
- Scheduled by each node’s **replication monitor thread**

---

### 🔄 Who Sends to Whom?

For a replica set of N nodes:

- Each node sends heartbeats to **(N - 1)** other nodes **independently**.
- These are **direct pings** (not ordered broadcasts or rings).

**Example (3-node replica set: mongo1, mongo2, mongo3):**

| Sender | Heartbeats sent to |
| ------ | ------------------ |
| mongo1 | → mongo2, mongo3   |
| mongo2 | → mongo1, mongo3   |
| mongo3 | → mongo1, mongo2   |

Each node handles its own heartbeat schedule. There is **no master coordinator** or round-robin system.

---

### 📦 Internals Behind the Scenes

- Heartbeats are sent by **`Replication Coordinator threads`** in each `mongod`.
- The heartbeat is a **low-cost internal `isMaster`/`hello`-like command**.
- Responses include:

  - Node state (PRIMARY/SECONDARY/etc.)
  - Set name
  - Config version
  - Election ID and term
  - Sync source information

---

### 🧪 Logs You’ll See (Example)

In `docker logs mongo1`:

```
[Replication] Sending heartbeat to mongo2:27017
[Replication] Received heartbeat from mongo2:27017 (state: SECONDARY)
```

---

# 13. What If a Node Misses Heartbeats?

- After **3 missed heartbeats (≈10 seconds)**, a node is considered **down**.
- If the down node was PRIMARY, an **election** is triggered.
- The new PRIMARY is picked based on **highest priority, oplog freshness**, and **availability**.

---

### 🧠 Summary:

- **Each node independently sends** heartbeat pings to others every 2s.
- Heartbeats are **not ordered** — they are **concurrent and distributed**.
- This model ensures **high availability and fast failure detection**.
